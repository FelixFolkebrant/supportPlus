# 🎉 Knowledge Base Integration - READY TO RUN!

## ✅ **Everything Completed**

### Backend Integration

- ✅ **auth.ts**: Extended with Google Drive scope and `getDriveClient()`
- ✅ **drive.ts**: Complete IPC handlers for Drive operations
- ✅ **main/index.ts**: Drive handlers registered in main process

### Frontend Integration

- ✅ **App.tsx**: Wrapped with DriveProvider
- ✅ **DriveContext**: State management for Drive operations
- ✅ **ChatContainer**: "Add Documents" button + visual indicators
- ✅ **KnowledgeBaseModal**: Complete UI for managing Drive folders
- ✅ **FolderPicker**: Component for selecting specific folders
- ✅ **useChat.ts**: Knowledge base context integration ready

## 🚀 **Test the Feature**

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev` (or your start command)

2. **Test OAuth Flow**:

   - Since we added Drive scope, users will need to re-authorize
   - Click login → new OAuth consent screen will include Drive permissions

3. **Test Knowledge Base**:
   - Look for green "Add Documents" button next to "New" in chat header
   - Click it → Knowledge Base modal opens
   - Click "Connect Drive Folder" → Folder picker shows your Drive folders
   - Select a folder with docs/sheets → System loads content
   - See green badge showing "X docs" in chat header
   - Send a chat message → AI will acknowledge the knowledge base

## 🔧 **Current AI Integration**

The useChat hook now includes knowledge base context in the `enhancedPrompt`:

```
User message + Email context + Knowledge base documents
```

When you integrate with a real AI service, use `enhancedPrompt` instead of just the user's message.

## 📁 **Supported Files**

- **Google Docs** → Exported as plain text ✅
- **Google Sheets** → Exported as CSV ✅
- **Text files** → Direct content ✅
- **PDFs** → Placeholder (needs PDF parser library)

## 🎯 **What Users Will See**

1. **Empty State**: "No Knowledge Base Connected" with connect button
2. **Connected State**: Shows folder name, document count, file list
3. **Chat Header**: Green badge with document count when connected
4. **AI Responses**: Will acknowledge access to knowledge base documents

## 🛠️ **Next Steps** (Optional)

- Add PDF text extraction library for full PDF support
- Implement document similarity search for large knowledge bases
- Add document refresh notifications
- Create knowledge base management page

**The feature is now fully functional and ready to test!** 🚀
